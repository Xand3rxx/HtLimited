company will be perceived as unprofessional or of low quality.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\r\n<ol><li>Use only high quality images on your website, low quality images may reflect bad image or poor quality, consider hiring a professional photographer to take some shots of staff in office or engineers working on site, these photos can be used on the website and for other marketing materials so don’t forget to archive these photos and label them for ease of use in future.</li><li>Consider adding the organizational chart of your company to the website, at least for upper management, this could ease the life of the website viewers as it would be clear who does what inside the organization, and who they need to contact.</li></ol>\r\n<!--

It’s your “Competitive Edge.” It’s the reason why customers buy from you, and you alone.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>USPs have helped many companies succeed. And they can help you too when you’re&nbsp;<strong>marketing</strong>&nbsp;yourself (when seeking a promotion, finding a new job, or just making sure that you get the recognition you deserve.)

Move beyond the basics that are common to all suppliers in the industry, and look at the criteria that customers use to decide which product or service to buy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>As with all brainstorming, by involving knowledgeable people in the process, you’ll improve the range of characteristics you’ll identify.

Being as objective as you can, score yourself and each of your competitors out of 10 for each characteristic. Where possible, base your scores on objective data. Where this isn’t possible, do your best to see things from a customer’s perspective and then make your best guess.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":3} -->\r\n<ol start=\"3\"><li><strong>Identify Where You Rank Well</strong></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Plot these points on a graph.

You can be sure that as soon as you start to promote a USP, your competitors will do what they can to neutralize it.

Time Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You experience time stress when you worry about time, or the lack thereof. You worry about the number of things that you have to do, and you fear that you’ll fail to achieve something important. You might feel trapped, unhappy, or even hopeless.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Common examples of time stress include worrying about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/albrecht-stress.htm#\">deadlines</a>&nbsp;or rushing to avoid being late for a meeting.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Time Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Time stress is one of the most common types of stress that we experience today. It is essential to learn how to manage this type of stress if you’re going to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/albrecht-stress.htm#\">work productively</a>&nbsp;in a busy organization.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>First, learn good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/main/newMN_HTE.htm\">time management skills</a>. This can include using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_05.htm\">To-Do Lists</a>&nbsp;or, if you have to manage many simultaneous projects,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_83.htm\">Action Programs</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Next, make sure that you’re devoting enough time to your important priorities. Unfortunately, it’s easy to get caught up in seemingly urgent tasks which actually have little impact on your overall objectives. This can leave you feeling exhausted, or feeling that you worked a full day yet accomplished nothing meaningful.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Your important tasks are usually the ones that will help you reach your goals, and working on these projects is a better use of your time. Our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm\">Eisenhower’s Urgent/Important Principle</a>&nbsp;explains how to balance urgent and important tasks, and our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_92.htm\">prioritization</a>&nbsp;helps you separate tasks that you need to focus on from those you can safely put off.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you often feel that you don’t have enough time to complete all of your tasks, learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creating-time.htm\">create more time in your day</a>. This might mean coming in early or working late, so that you have quiet time to focus. You should also use your peak working time to concentrate on your most important tasks – because you’re working more efficiently, this helps you do more with the time you have.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For instance, if you’re a morning person, schedule the tasks that need the greatest concentration during this time. Our article “<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_79.htm\">Is This a Morning Task</a>” helps you learn how to prioritize your tasks and schedule them during your most productive times of day. You can leave less important tasks, like checking email, for times when your energy levels drop.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Also, make sure that you’re polite but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Assertiveness.htm\">assertive</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCS_92.htm\">saying “no”</a>&nbsp;to tasks that you don’t have the capacity to do.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>2. Anticipatory Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Anticipatory stress describes stress that you experience concerning the future. Sometimes this stress can be focused on a specific event, such as an upcoming presentation that you’re going to give. However, anticipatory stress can also be vague and undefined, such as an overall sense of dread about the future, or a worry that “something will go wrong.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Anticipatory Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because anticipatory stress is future based, start by recognizing that the event you’re dreading doesn’t have to play out as you imagine. Use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_81.htm\">positive visualization techniques</a>&nbsp;to imagine the situation going right.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Sculpture-Unlocking-Untapped-Potential/dp/0880642211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research shows</a>&nbsp;that your mind often can’t tell the difference, on a basic neurological level, between a situation that you’ve visualized going well repeatedly and one that’s actually happened.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Other techniques – like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_79.htm\">meditation</a>&nbsp;– will help you develop focus and the ability to concentrate on what’s happening right now, rather than on an imagined future. Consider setting aside time daily – even if it’s only five minutes – to meditate.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Anticipatory stress can result from a lack of confidence. For example, you might be stressing over a presentation that you’re giving next week, because you’re afraid that your presentation won’t be interesting. Often, addressing these personal fears directly will lower your stress. In this example, if you put in extra time to practice and prepare for tough questions, you’ll likely feel more prepared for the event.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Last, learn how to overcome a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/fear-of-failure.htm\">fear of failure</a>: by making contingency plans and analyzing all of the possible outcomes, you’ll get a clearer idea of what could happen in the future. This can help diminish your fear of failure and give you a greater sense of control over events.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>3. Situational Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You experience situational stress when you’re in a scary situation that you have no control over. This could be an emergency. More commonly, however, it’s a situation that involves conflict, or a loss of status or acceptance in the eyes of your group. For instance, getting laid off or making a major mistake in front of your team are examples of events that can cause situational stress.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Situational Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Situational stress often appears suddenly, for example, you might get caught in a situation that you completely failed to anticipate. To manage situational stress better, learn to be more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_45.htm\">self-awar</a>e. This means recognizing the “automatic” physical and emotional signals that your body sends out when you’re under pressure.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, imagine that the meeting you’re in suddenly dissolves into a shouting match between team members. Your automatic response is to feel a surge of anxiety. Your stomach knots and feels bloated. You withdraw into yourself and, if someone asks for your input, you have a difficult time knowing what to say.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Conflict is a major source of situational stress. Learn effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_81.htm\">conflict resolution skills</a>, so that you’re well-prepared to handle the stress of conflict when it arises. It’s also important to learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_65.htm\">manage conflict in meetings</a>, since resolving group conflict can be different from resolving individual issues.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Everyone reacts to situational stress differently, and it’s essential that you understand both the physical and emotional symptoms of this stress, so that you can manage them appropriately. For instance, if your natural tendency is to withdraw emotionally, then learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ThinkingonYourFeet.htm\">think on your feet</a>&nbsp;and communicate better during these situations. If your natural response is to get angry and shout, then learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_41.htm\">manage your emotions</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>4. Encounter Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Encounter stress revolves around people. You experience encounter stress when you worry about interacting with a certain person or group of people – you may not like them, or you might think that they’re unpredictable.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Encounter stress can also occur if your role involves a lot of personal interactions with customers or clients, especially if those groups are in distress. For instance, physicians and social workers have high rates of encounter stress, because the people they work with routinely don’t feel well, or are deeply upset.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This type of stress also occurs from “contact overload”: when you feel overwhelmed or drained from interacting with too many people.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Encounter Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because encounter stress is focused entirely on people, you’ll manage this type of stress better by working on your people skills. To find out how good your people skills are, take our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_36.htm\">quiz</a>, and discover the areas that you need to develop.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>A good place to start is to develop greater&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_59.htm\">emotional intelligence</a>. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize the emotions, wants, and needs of yourself and of others. This is an important skill in interacting with others and in building good relationships.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It’s also important to know when you’re about to reach your limit for interactions in the day. Everyone has different symptoms for encounter stress, but a common one is withdrawing psychologically from others and working mechanically.

Time Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You experience time stress when you worry about time, or the lack thereof. You worry about the number of things that you have to do, and you fear that you’ll fail to achieve something important. You might feel trapped, unhappy, or even hopeless.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Common examples of time stress include worrying about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/albrecht-stress.htm#\">deadlines</a>&nbsp;or rushing to avoid being late for a meeting.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Time Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Time stress is one of the most common types of stress that we experience today. It is essential to learn how to manage this type of stress if you’re going to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/albrecht-stress.htm#\">work productively</a>&nbsp;in a busy organization.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>First, learn good&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/main/newMN_HTE.htm\">time management skills</a>. This can include using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_05.htm\">To-Do Lists</a>&nbsp;or, if you have to manage many simultaneous projects,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_83.htm\">Action Programs</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Next, make sure that you’re devoting enough time to your important priorities. Unfortunately, it’s easy to get caught up in seemingly urgent tasks which actually have little impact on your overall objectives. This can leave you feeling exhausted, or feeling that you worked a full day yet accomplished nothing meaningful.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Your important tasks are usually the ones that will help you reach your goals, and working on these projects is a better use of your time. Our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_91.htm\">Eisenhower’s Urgent/Important Principle</a>&nbsp;explains how to balance urgent and important tasks, and our article on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_92.htm\">prioritization</a>&nbsp;helps you separate tasks that you need to focus on from those you can safely put off.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you often feel that you don’t have enough time to complete all of your tasks, learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/creating-time.htm\">create more time in your day</a>. This might mean coming in early or working late, so that you have quiet time to focus. You should also use your peak working time to concentrate on your most important tasks – because you’re working more efficiently, this helps you do more with the time you have.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For instance, if you’re a morning person, schedule the tasks that need the greatest concentration during this time. Our article “<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_79.htm\">Is This a Morning Task</a>” helps you learn how to prioritize your tasks and schedule them during your most productive times of day. You can leave less important tasks, like checking email, for times when your energy levels drop.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Also, make sure that you’re polite but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/Assertiveness.htm\">assertive</a>&nbsp;about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCS_92.htm\">saying “no”</a>&nbsp;to tasks that you don’t have the capacity to do.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>2. Anticipatory Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Anticipatory stress describes stress that you experience concerning the future. Sometimes this stress can be focused on a specific event, such as an upcoming presentation that you’re going to give. However, anticipatory stress can also be vague and undefined, such as an overall sense of dread about the future, or a worry that “something will go wrong.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Anticipatory Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because anticipatory stress is future based, start by recognizing that the event you’re dreading doesn’t have to play out as you imagine. Use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_81.htm\">positive visualization techniques</a>&nbsp;to imagine the situation going right.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mind-Sculpture-Unlocking-Untapped-Potential/dp/0880642211\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Research shows</a>&nbsp;that your mind often can’t tell the difference, on a basic neurological level, between a situation that you’ve visualized going well repeatedly and one that’s actually happened.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Other techniques – like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_79.htm\">meditation</a>&nbsp;– will help you develop focus and the ability to concentrate on what’s happening right now, rather than on an imagined future. Consider setting aside time daily – even if it’s only five minutes – to meditate.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Anticipatory stress can result from a lack of confidence. For example, you might be stressing over a presentation that you’re giving next week, because you’re afraid that your presentation won’t be interesting. Often, addressing these personal fears directly will lower your stress. In this example, if you put in extra time to practice and prepare for tough questions, you’ll likely feel more prepared for the event.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Last, learn how to overcome a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/fear-of-failure.htm\">fear of failure</a>: by making contingency plans and analyzing all of the possible outcomes, you’ll get a clearer idea of what could happen in the future. This can help diminish your fear of failure and give you a greater sense of control over events.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>3. Situational Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You experience situational stress when you’re in a scary situation that you have no control over. This could be an emergency. More commonly, however, it’s a situation that involves conflict, or a loss of status or acceptance in the eyes of your group. For instance, getting laid off or making a major mistake in front of your team are examples of events that can cause situational stress.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Situational Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Situational stress often appears suddenly, for example, you might get caught in a situation that you completely failed to anticipate. To manage situational stress better, learn to be more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_45.htm\">self-awar</a>e. This means recognizing the “automatic” physical and emotional signals that your body sends out when you’re under pressure.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, imagine that the meeting you’re in suddenly dissolves into a shouting match between team members. Your automatic response is to feel a surge of anxiety. Your stomach knots and feels bloated. You withdraw into yourself and, if someone asks for your input, you have a difficult time knowing what to say.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Conflict is a major source of situational stress. Learn effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_81.htm\">conflict resolution skills</a>, so that you’re well-prepared to handle the stress of conflict when it arises. It’s also important to learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_65.htm\">manage conflict in meetings</a>, since resolving group conflict can be different from resolving individual issues.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Everyone reacts to situational stress differently, and it’s essential that you understand both the physical and emotional symptoms of this stress, so that you can manage them appropriately. For instance, if your natural tendency is to withdraw emotionally, then learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/ThinkingonYourFeet.htm\">think on your feet</a>&nbsp;and communicate better during these situations. If your natural response is to get angry and shout, then learn how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_41.htm\">manage your emotions</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>4. Encounter Stress</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Encounter stress revolves around people. You experience encounter stress when you worry about interacting with a certain person or group of people – you may not like them, or you might think that they’re unpredictable.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Encounter stress can also occur if your role involves a lot of personal interactions with customers or clients, especially if those groups are in distress. For instance, physicians and social workers have high rates of encounter stress, because the people they work with routinely don’t feel well, or are deeply upset.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This type of stress also occurs from “contact overload”: when you feel overwhelmed or drained from interacting with too many people.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>Managing Encounter Stress</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Because encounter stress is focused entirely on people, you’ll manage this type of stress better by working on your people skills. To find out how good your people skills are, take our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTMM_36.htm\">quiz</a>, and discover the areas that you need to develop.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>A good place to start is to develop greater&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newCDV_59.htm\">emotional intelligence</a>. Emotional intelligence is the ability to recognize the emotions, wants, and needs of yourself and of others. This is an important skill in interacting with others and in building good relationships.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It’s also important to know when you’re about to reach your limit for interactions in the day. Everyone has different symptoms for encounter stress, but a common one is withdrawing psychologically from others and working mechanically. Another common symptom is getting cranky, cold, or impersonal with others in your interactions. When you start to experience these symptoms, do whatever you can to take a break. Go for a walk, drink water, and practice&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newTCS_05.htm\">deep breathing exercises</a>.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><a href=\"https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/EmpathyatWork.htm\">Empathy</a>&nbsp;is a valuable skill for coping with this type of stress, because it allows you to see the situation from the other person’s perspective.

Sure, those will change as the company grows but knowing how the team defines “doing well” and sets their goals will only help new hires get acclimated. In addition, it helps you create the dreaded performance evaluation. Not all companies have or enforce these, but I believe they are important, especially given the influx of millennials in today’s workforce. The key is constant and measurable feedback, rather than the typical year review. Keep that in mind when devising your performance evaluation program (or when selecting a vendor to do so).</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":9} -->\r\n<ol start=\"9\"><li><strong>Travel and Expenses Tracking</strong></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>How will your organization handle this?

Whether you use an application to implement this or an old-fashioned Outlook add-on, make sure your policies are clear before employee’s Day 1. If you are in an industry that frequently uses overtime structure, keep that in mind as well.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":11} -->\r\n<ol start=\"11\"><li><strong>The end of the road</strong></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>At some point you will have to fire someone…or someone will quit. Turnover is a part of life and must be addressed (preferably before it happens on your watch). So how are you going to handle it? Are you going to conduct an exit interview? Will you have a sit-down with the exiting employee’s supervisor or manager? Is there a formal process (like written and verbal warnings) that precedes terminating an employee? Do you request two week’s notice? Are you an at-will employee? Figuring out all these answers ahead of time will save an unpleasant task far less messy.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true,\"start\":12} -->\r\n<ol start=\"12\"><li><strong>Training and Development</strong></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Like many smaller businesses, you may not yet have set up a training and development process, which is okay (for now). But start thinking about what the employees get out of working for you. You may not be able to bring in big name speakers to train your crew but you can build a mentoring program, support professional initiatives or leverage your vendors for useful training opportunities (like webinars and white papers series). The important thing is to have a plan in place, whether the budget exists or not, but even more importantly is getting buy-in from the managers in your company. They know what sort of learning opportunities their people need and how to ferret them out.

Some progressive companies tell the corporate and cultural story up front and follow up with individualized job descriptions. Either way, have a standardized template that you can give to team members or use when you need to get something up FAST.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'App\\Models\\Post', 15, 'page', '2021-11-27 15:34:45', '2021-11-27 15:34:45'),

This is because there’s a fine line between assertiveness and aggression, and people can often confuse the two. For this reason, it’s useful to define the two behaviors so that we can clearly separate them:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list -->\r\n<ul><li><strong>Assertiveness is based on balance.&nbsp;</strong>It requires being forthright about your wants and needs, while still considering the rights, needs and wants of others. When you’re assertive, you are self assured and draw power from this to get your point across firmly, fairly and with empathy.</li><li><strong>Aggressive behavior is based on winning.</strong>&nbsp;You do what is in your own best interest without regard for the rights, needs, feelings, or desires of other people. When you’re aggressive, the power you use is selfish. You may come across as pushy or even bullying. You take what you want, often without asking.</li></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, a boss who places a pile of work on your desk the afternoon before you go on vacation, and demands that it gets done straight away, is being aggressive. The work needs to be done but, by dumping it on you at an inappropriate time, he or she disregards your needs and feelings.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When you, on the other hand, inform your boss that the work will be done but only after you return from vacation, you hit the sweet spot between passivity (not being assertive enough) and aggression (being hostile, angry or rude). You assert your own rights while recognizing your boss’s need to get the job done.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Warning:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Assertive behavior may not be appropriate in all workplaces. Some organizational and national cultures may prefer people to be passive and may view assertive behavior as rude or even offensive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Research has also suggested that gender can have a bearing on how assertive behavior is perceived, with men more likely to be rewarded for being assertive than women. So, it pays to consider the context in which you work before you start changing your behavior.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Being Assertive</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of being assertive is that it can help you to become more self-confident, as you gain a better understanding of who you are and the value that you offer.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Assertiveness provides several other benefits that can help you both in your workplace and in other areas of your life.

So, if your disposition tends to be more passive or aggressive, then it’s a good idea to work on the following areas to help you to get the balance right:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>1. Value Yourself and Your Rights</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To be more assertive, you need to gain a good understand yourself, as well as a strong belief in your inherent value and your value&nbsp;to your organization and team.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This self-belief is the basis of self- confidence&nbsp;and assertive behavior. It will help you to recognize that you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, give you the confidence to stick up for your rights and protect them, and remain true to yourself, your wants and your needs.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>While self-confidence is an important aspect of assertiveness, it’s crucial that you make sure that it doesn’t develop into a sense of self-importance. Your rights, thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires are just as important as everyone else’s, but not&nbsp;<strong>more&nbsp;</strong>important than anyone else’s.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>2. Voice Your Needs and Wants Confidently</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you’re going to perform to your full potential then you need to make sure that your priorities – your needs and wants – are met.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t wait for someone else to recognize what you need. You might wait forever! Take the initiative and start to identify the things that you want now. Then, set goals so that you can achieve them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Once you’ve done this, you can tell your boss or your colleague exactly what it is that you need from them to help you to achieve these goals in a clear and confident way. And don’t forget to stick to your guns. Even if what you want isn’t possible right now, ask (politely) whether you can revisit your request in six months time.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Find ways to make requests that avoid sacrificing others’ needs. Remember, you want people to help you, and asking for things in an overly aggressive or pushy way is likely to put them off doing this and may even damage your relationship.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>3. Acknowledge That You Can’t Control Other People’s Behavior</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t make the mistake of accepting responsibility for how people react to your assertiveness. If they, for example, act angry or resentful toward you, try to avoid reacting to them in the same way.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Remember that you can only control yourself and your own behavior, so do your best to stay calm and measured if things get tense. As long as you are being respectful and not violating someone else’s needs, then you have the right to say or do what you want.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>4. Express Yourself in a Positive Way</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It’s important to say what’s on your mind, even when you have a difficult or negative issue to deal with. But you must do it constructively and sensitively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and to confront people who challenge you and/or your rights. You can even allow yourself to be angry! But remember to control your emotions and to stay respectful at all times.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>5. Be Open to Criticism and Compliments</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Accept both positive and negative feedback graciously, humblyand positively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you don’t agree with criticism that you receive then you need to be prepared to say so, but without getting defensive or angry. The feedback matrix&nbsp;is a great tool that can help you to see past your emotional reactions to feedback, and instead use it to achieve significant, positive change.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>6. Learn to Say “No”</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>sayin “No” is hard to do, especially when you’re not used to doing it, but it’s vital if you want to become more assertive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Knowing your own limits&nbsp;and how much work you are able to take on will help you to manage your tasks more effectively, and to pinpoint any areas of your job that make you feel as though you’re being taken advantage of.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Remember that you can’t possibly do everything or please everyone, so it’s important that you protect your time and your workload by saying “no” when necessary. When you do have to say “no,” try to find a win-win solution&nbsp;that works for everyone.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>7. Use Assertive Communication Techniques</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>There are a number of simple but effective communication techniques that you can use to become more assertive. These are:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Use “I” Statements</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Use “I want”, “I need” or “I feel” to convey basic assertions and get your point across firmly. For example, “I feel strongly that we need to bring in a third party to mediate this disagreement.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Empathy</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Always try to recognize and understand&nbsp;how the other person views the situation. Then, after taking her point of view into consideration, express what you need from her.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, “I understand that you’re having trouble working with Arlene, but this project needs to be completed by Friday. Let’s all sit down and come up with a plan together.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Escalation</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If your first attempts at asserting yourself have been unsuccessful, then you may need to escalate the matter further. This means becoming firmer (though still polite and respectful) with the person who you are requesting help from, and may end in you telling him what you will do next if you still aren’t satisfied.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, “John, this is the third time this week I’ve had to speak to you about arriving late. If you’re late once more this month, I will activate the disciplinary process.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, remember that, regardless of the consequences that you communicate to the person in question, you may still not get what you want in the end. If this is the case, you may need to take further action by setting up a&nbsp;formal meeting to talk about the problem, or escalating your concerns to Human Resources (HR) or your boss.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Ask for More Time</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Sometimes, it’s best not to say anything. You might be too emotional or you might not know what it is that you want yet.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If this is the case, be honest and tell the person that you need a few minutes to compose your thoughts. For example, you might say “Dave, your request has caught me off guard. I’ll get back to you within the half hour.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Change Your Verbs</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Try using verbs that are more definite and emphatic when you communicate. This will help you to send a clear message and avoid “sugar-coating” your message so much that people are left confused by what it is that you want from them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To do this, use verbs like “will” instead of “could” or “should,” “want” instead of “need,” or “choose to” instead of “have to.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>will</strong>&nbsp;be going on vacation next week, so I&nbsp;<strong>will&nbsp;</strong>need someone to cover my workload.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>want</strong>&nbsp;to go on this training course because I believe that it will help me to progress in my role and my career.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>choose</strong>&nbsp;this option because I think it will prove to be more successful than the other options on the table.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Be a Broken Record</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Prepare the message that you want to convey ahead of time.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If, for instance, you can’t take on any more work, be direct and say, “I cannot take on any more projects right now.” If people still don’t get the message, then keep restating your message using the same language, and don’t relent. Eventually they will likely realize that you really mean what you’re saying.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I’d like you to work on the Clancy project.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I’ll pay extra for you to do it.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“Seriously, this is really important. My boss insists that this gets done.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“Will you do it as a personal favor?”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I’m sorry, I value our relationship but I simply cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Be careful with the broken record technique. If you use it to protect yourself from exploitation, that’s good. But if you use it to bully someone into taking action that’s against their interests, it can be manipulative and dishonest.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Scripting</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It can often be hard to know how to put your feelings across clearly and confidently to someone when you need to assert yourself. The scripting technique can help here. It allows you to prepare what you want to say in advance, using a four-pronged approach that describes:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\r\n<ol><li><strong>The event.</strong>&nbsp;Tell the other person exactly how you see the situation or problem.<em>“Janine, the production costs this month are 23 percent higher than average. You didn’t give me any indication of this, which meant that I was completely surprised by the news.”</em></li><li><strong>Your feelings.</strong>&nbsp;Describe how you feel about the situation and express your emotions clearly.<em>“This frustrates me, and makes me feel like you don’t understand or appreciate how important financial controls are in the company.”</em></li><li><strong>Your needs.&nbsp;</strong>Tell the other person exactly what you need from her so that she doesn’t have to guess.<em>“I need you to be honest with me, and let me know when we start going significantly over budget on anything.”</em></li><li><strong>The consequences.</strong>&nbsp;Describe the positive impact that your request will have for the other person or the company if your needs are met successfully.<em>“If you do this we will be in a good position to hit our targets and may get a better end-of-year bonus.”</em></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Key Points</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Being assertive means finding the right balance between passivity (not assertive enough) and aggression (angry or hostile behavior). It means having a strong sense of yourself and your value, and acknowledging that you deserve to get what you want. And it means standing up for yourself even in the most difficult situations.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>What being assertive doesn’t mean is acting in your own interest without considering other people’s rights, feelings, desires, or needs – that is aggression.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You can learn to be more assertive over time by identifying your needs and wants, expressing them in a positive way, and learning to say “no” when you need to. You can also use assertive communication techniques to help you to communicate your thoughts and feelings firmly and directly.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It likely won’t happen overnight but, by practising these techniques regularly, you will slowly build up the confidence and self-belief that you need to become assertive.

When you’re assertive, you are self assured and draw power from this to get your point across firmly, fairly and with empathy.</li><li><strong>Aggressive behavior is based on winning.</strong>&nbsp;You do what is in your own best interest without regard for the rights, needs, feelings, or desires of other people. When you’re aggressive, the power you use is selfish. You may come across as pushy or even bullying. You take what you want, often without asking.</li></ul>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>So, a boss who places a pile of work on your desk the afternoon before you go on vacation, and demands that it gets done straight away, is being aggressive. The work needs to be done but, by dumping it on you at an inappropriate time, he or she disregards your needs and feelings.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>When you, on the other hand, inform your boss that the work will be done but only after you return from vacation, you hit the sweet spot between passivity (not being assertive enough) and aggression (being hostile, angry or rude). You assert your own rights while recognizing your boss’s need to get the job done.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Warning:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Assertive behavior may not be appropriate in all workplaces. Some organizational and national cultures may prefer people to be passive and may view assertive behavior as rude or even offensive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Research has also suggested that gender can have a bearing on how assertive behavior is perceived, with men more likely to be rewarded for being assertive than women. So, it pays to consider the context in which you work before you start changing your behavior.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>The Benefits of Being Assertive</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the main benefits of being assertive is that it can help you to become more self-confident, as you gain a better understanding of who you are and the value that you offer.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Assertiveness provides several other benefits that can help you both in your workplace and in other areas of your life.

So, if your disposition tends to be more passive or aggressive, then it’s a good idea to work on the following areas to help you to get the balance right:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>1. Value Yourself and Your Rights</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To be more assertive, you need to gain a good understand yourself, as well as a strong belief in your inherent value and your value&nbsp;to your organization and team.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>This self-belief is the basis of self- confidence&nbsp;and assertive behavior. It will help you to recognize that you deserve to be treated with dignity and respect, give you the confidence to stick up for your rights and protect them, and remain true to yourself, your wants and your needs.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>While self-confidence is an important aspect of assertiveness, it’s crucial that you make sure that it doesn’t develop into a sense of self-importance. Your rights, thoughts, feelings, needs, and desires are just as important as everyone else’s, but not&nbsp;<strong>more&nbsp;</strong>important than anyone else’s.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>2. Voice Your Needs and Wants Confidently</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you’re going to perform to your full potential then you need to make sure that your priorities – your needs and wants – are met.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t wait for someone else to recognize what you need. You might wait forever! Take the initiative and start to identify the things that you want now. Then, set goals so that you can achieve them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Once you’ve done this, you can tell your boss or your colleague exactly what it is that you need from them to help you to achieve these goals in a clear and confident way. And don’t forget to stick to your guns. Even if what you want isn’t possible right now, ask (politely) whether you can revisit your request in six months time.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Find ways to make requests that avoid sacrificing others’ needs. Remember, you want people to help you, and asking for things in an overly aggressive or pushy way is likely to put them off doing this and may even damage your relationship.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>3. Acknowledge That You Can’t Control Other People’s Behavior</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t make the mistake of accepting responsibility for how people react to your assertiveness. If they, for example, act angry or resentful toward you, try to avoid reacting to them in the same way.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Remember that you can only control yourself and your own behavior, so do your best to stay calm and measured if things get tense. As long as you are being respectful and not violating someone else’s needs, then you have the right to say or do what you want.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>4. Express Yourself in a Positive Way</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It’s important to say what’s on your mind, even when you have a difficult or negative issue to deal with. But you must do it constructively and sensitively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself and to confront people who challenge you and/or your rights. You can even allow yourself to be angry! But remember to control your emotions and to stay respectful at all times.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>5. Be Open to Criticism and Compliments</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Accept both positive and negative feedback graciously, humblyand positively.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If you don’t agree with criticism that you receive then you need to be prepared to say so, but without getting defensive or angry. The feedback matrix&nbsp;is a great tool that can help you to see past your emotional reactions to feedback, and instead use it to achieve significant, positive change.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>6. Learn to Say “No”</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>sayin “No” is hard to do, especially when you’re not used to doing it, but it’s vital if you want to become more assertive.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Knowing your own limits&nbsp;and how much work you are able to take on will help you to manage your tasks more effectively, and to pinpoint any areas of your job that make you feel as though you’re being taken advantage of.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Remember that you can’t possibly do everything or please everyone, so it’s important that you protect your time and your workload by saying “no” when necessary. When you do have to say “no,” try to find a win-win solution&nbsp;that works for everyone.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":3} -->\r\n<h3>7. Use Assertive Communication Techniques</h3>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>There are a number of simple but effective communication techniques that you can use to become more assertive. These are:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Use “I” Statements</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Use “I want”, “I need” or “I feel” to convey basic assertions and get your point across firmly. For example, “I feel strongly that we need to bring in a third party to mediate this disagreement.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Empathy</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Always try to recognize and understand&nbsp;how the other person views the situation. Then, after taking her point of view into consideration, express what you need from her.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, “I understand that you’re having trouble working with Arlene, but this project needs to be completed by Friday. Let’s all sit down and come up with a plan together.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Escalation</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If your first attempts at asserting yourself have been unsuccessful, then you may need to escalate the matter further. This means becoming firmer (though still polite and respectful) with the person who you are requesting help from, and may end in you telling him what you will do next if you still aren’t satisfied.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example, “John, this is the third time this week I’ve had to speak to you about arriving late. If you’re late once more this month, I will activate the disciplinary process.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>However, remember that, regardless of the consequences that you communicate to the person in question, you may still not get what you want in the end. If this is the case, you may need to take further action by setting up a&nbsp;formal meeting to talk about the problem, or escalating your concerns to Human Resources (HR) or your boss.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Ask for More Time</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Sometimes, it’s best not to say anything. You might be too emotional or you might not know what it is that you want yet.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If this is the case, be honest and tell the person that you need a few minutes to compose your thoughts. For example, you might say “Dave, your request has caught me off guard. I’ll get back to you within the half hour.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Change Your Verbs</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Try using verbs that are more definite and emphatic when you communicate. This will help you to send a clear message and avoid “sugar-coating” your message so much that people are left confused by what it is that you want from them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>To do this, use verbs like “will” instead of “could” or “should,” “want” instead of “need,” or “choose to” instead of “have to.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>will</strong>&nbsp;be going on vacation next week, so I&nbsp;<strong>will&nbsp;</strong>need someone to cover my workload.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>want</strong>&nbsp;to go on this training course because I believe that it will help me to progress in my role and my career.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I&nbsp;<strong>choose</strong>&nbsp;this option because I think it will prove to be more successful than the other options on the table.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Be a Broken Record</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Prepare the message that you want to convey ahead of time.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>If, for instance, you can’t take on any more work, be direct and say, “I cannot take on any more projects right now.” If people still don’t get the message, then keep restating your message using the same language, and don’t relent. Eventually they will likely realize that you really mean what you’re saying.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For example:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I’d like you to work on the Clancy project.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“I’ll pay extra for you to do it.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“Seriously, this is really important. My boss insists that this gets done.”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>“Will you do it as a personal favor?”</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><em>“I’m sorry, I value our relationship but I simply cannot take on any more projects right now.”</em></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Tip:</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Be careful with the broken record technique. If you use it to protect yourself from exploitation, that’s good. But if you use it to bully someone into taking action that’s against their interests, it can be manipulative and dishonest.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading {\"level\":4} -->\r\n<h4>Scripting</h4>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It can often be hard to know how to put your feelings across clearly and confidently to someone when you need to assert yourself. The scripting technique can help here. It allows you to prepare what you want to say in advance, using a four-pronged approach that describes:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:list {\"ordered\":true} -->\r\n<ol><li><strong>The event.</strong>&nbsp;Tell the other person exactly how you see the situation or problem.<em>“Janine, the production costs this month are 23 percent higher than average. You didn’t give me any indication of this, which meant that I was completely surprised by the news.”</em></li><li><strong>Your feelings.</strong>&nbsp;Describe how you feel about the situation and express your emotions clearly.<em>“This frustrates me, and makes me feel like you don’t understand or appreciate how important financial controls are in the company.”</em></li><li><strong>Your needs.&nbsp;</strong>Tell the other person exactly what you need from her so that she doesn’t have to guess.<em>“I need you to be honest with me, and let me know when we start going significantly over budget on anything.”</em></li><li><strong>The consequences.</strong>&nbsp;Describe the positive impact that your request will have for the other person or the company if your needs are met successfully.<em>“If you do this we will be in a good position to hit our targets and may get a better end-of-year bonus.”</em></li></ol>\r\n<!-- /wp:list -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:heading -->\r\n<h2>Key Points</h2>\r\n<!-- /wp:heading -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Being assertive means finding the right balance between passivity (not assertive enough) and aggression (angry or hostile behavior). It means having a strong sense of yourself and your value, and acknowledging that you deserve to get what you want. And it means standing up for yourself even in the most difficult situations.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>What being assertive doesn’t mean is acting in your own interest without considering other people’s rights, feelings, desires, or needs – that is aggression.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>You can learn to be more assertive over time by identifying your needs and wants, expressing them in a positive way, and learning to say “no” when you need to. You can also use assertive communication techniques to help you to communicate your thoughts and feelings firmly and directly.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>It likely won’t happen overnight but, by practising these techniques regularly, you will slowly build up the confidence and self-belief that you need to become assertive. You’ll also likely find that you become more productive, efficient and respected, too.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->', 'App\\Models\\Post', 16, 'page', '2021-11-27 15:55:32', '2021-11-27 15:55:32'),

Most companies that outsource human resources functions do so by joining a professional employer organization, or PEO. More than just a payroll processor, a PEO handles everything from hiring and onboarding employees to managing benefits, developing training programs and overseeing compliance with employment rules and regulations. Although outsourcing HR might not be right for all businesses, there are some significant advantages to doing so, especially when it comes to saving time and money.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Outsourcing Reduces Costs</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>One of the biggest advantages to outsourcing HR functions is the fact that it can save your company money.

The average human resources manager earns more than N9,500,000 per year, plus benefits.

Outsourcing those jobs to a PEO can significantly reduce that expense.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Reduced costs for benefits, as the PEO can negotiate better rates for a large pool of clients.

But we too often fail to realise that culture is both a source of inspiration and a means of realising our thoughts and ideas, that culture makes it possible to mend the social fabric, to forge new forms of solidarity, to create new spaces in which to draw the energy needed to meet together the intense challenges facing us.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We have an opportunity to build back better, designing policies that allow culture to fulfil its role as the fourth pillar of sustainable development.

To harness this potential, the Culture 2030 Goal movement, in the context of its engagement in the United Nations 2030 Agenda, calls on UN agencies, governments and all other stakeholders to act.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Covid-19 pandemic is an unprecedented challenge requiring an unprecedented response. All actors can and should play their part, not least the cultural communities, sectors, actors and agents.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Clearly, the primary concern must be health. We would like to extend our thanks to all those working in the frontlines, in particular the hospitals, public health teams and elsewhere in the health sector who are doing so much to care for the ill and protect the well now, as well as all other essential service providers.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Alongside them, artists, creators and culture professionals, as well as organisations in the culture sector, have a fundamental role in promoting well-being and resilience in individuals and communities, guarantee access to information, encourage awareness, tolerance and build the capacities to imagine the societies of the future, which are already in formation due to the ongoing global upheaval.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The cultural communities have responded. There have been countless initiatives to boost access and engagement and to create together new expressions, meanings and energies. They have all underlined the impressive power of culture to build healthy, resilient communities and improve well-being for all.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Yet we also need to think about the future. Even when the pandemic is declared over, the scars will remain.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Now more than ever, we need to recognise, incorporate, and support cultural concerns in our response to the crisis and planning for the recovery.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We believe that in doing so, we can contribute to ensuring that the crisis does not exacerbate the already high levels of inequality at the global level and often within national borders. This can particularly affect older people, minorities, women and girls, indigenous peoples and those with less access to health and other basic public services and economic resources. Appropriate cultural responses at the global, regional and domestic levels can take this reality into account, and place equality and non-discrimination at the centre.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We must also strengthen the global mindset and international cooperation that are critically needed, faced with the risk of closed borders and divisions in the international community. At the global level, appropriate resources and collaboration mechanisms including cultural cooperation, should recognise existing barriers and seek to address them.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Overall, responses to this pandemic should aim to be inclusive and look at a broader framework of inequality and challenges to sustainable development, including climate change and disaster risk reduction. The assertion that nothing will be the same in the aftermath of the crisis is becoming commonplace, and there is a call to rethink the way we live, work, produce, consume and relate to nature. But we too often fail to realise that culture is both a source of inspiration and a means of realising our thoughts and ideas, that culture makes it possible to mend the social fabric, to forge new forms of solidarity, to create new spaces in which to draw the energy needed to meet together the intense challenges facing us.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We have an opportunity to build back better, designing policies that allow culture to fulfil its role as the fourth pillar of sustainable development. Doing so will provide a more comprehensive frame to understand our world and make for stronger, more innovative, more tolerant and more resilient communities tomorrow.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Conversely, failing to support culture in this time of crisis will result in potentially irreversible losses to creators, artists and cultural professionals, who already often do not benefit from adequate protections, as well as damage to many cultural practices, resources and organisations. This risks triggering a considerable deterioration in the richness and diversity in all manifestations of culture – from heritage sites, museums, libraries and archives to traditional practices and contemporary cultural expressions – and the ability of culture to contribute to a better future.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Too often, in the past culture has been the first to be compromised in budget allocations and the most heavily affected economically and financially. We cannot accept that this happens again..</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>We therefore call on governments and all other decision-makers, in the choices they make now and for the future, to:</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Act today to support cultural communities, sectors, actors and agents where they are facing negative impacts from the pandemic, in order to ensure that they can survive the crisis, and are able to play their part in the recovery tomorrow.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Design and give access to mechanisms that strengthen cultural communities’ capacity and to access and make use of the digital sphere sustainably and in suitable conditions.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Ensure that appropriate flexibilities in laws, regulations and funding programmes are used in order to facilitate and support the work of cultural actors and the safeguarding of cultural heritage resources where this would otherwise be made impossible by the loss of revenue sources that guaranteed community livelihoods, notably tourism.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Ensure the long-term integration of culture across government action at all levels, everywhere, both as an end in itself and as an enabling factor in successful sustainable development, leaving no one and no place behind.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Place welfare, solidarity and sustainability at the centre of short-term and long-term cultural policies, programmes and projects, as well as making international cooperation, including cultural cooperation, central in the building of more resilient communities.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Reinforce the protection of the cultural rights of all in national and local legislation, in particular through cultural programmes aiming at education, active participation, critical citizenship, gender equality and the empowerment of indigenous peoples.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Incorporate culture explicitly into the plans, instruments and reporting mechanisms around the 2030 Agenda and the SDGs to be elaborated in the coming months and years, and especially for the High-Level Political Forum foreseen for July 2020.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>The Culture 2030 Goal movement welcomes endorsements of this statement via the following link and calls on the culture constituencies to come together to advocate collectively for the role of culture at the United Nations.

Maybe so, because you’re lucky enough to have the brains to work hard!” he says. That same concept, of course, was advocated by Benjamin Franklin in the 18th century.

Get a job in celebrity-based enterprises. Do you read Car &amp; Driver? ESPN.com? Yahoo Pets Forum?” Even if the field doesn’t seem lucrative, there are ways to make it to the top–something that’s more likely to happen if you love it.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>[For more, read: “<a href=\"http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=ApmXV9kqkoYwrSj41EjcLGnFLs8F/SIG=122klelh4/**http%3A/www.usnews.com/sections/business/your-money/index.html\">Juggling Your Money in the Recession</a>.”]</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Decide how much money you really want</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For many people, $1 million won’t be enough. “For most Gen-X and Gen-Yers, retiring with a couple million when they are 65 won’t be anywhere near enough to maintain even an average lifestyle, because that little pup called inflation is constantly nipping at your heels as you try to run towards building your own retirement nest-egg,” says Cartwood. A more reasonable goal might be $3 million– an amount that Cartwood considers the minimum to be a “bare bones millionaire” these days. Consider your ideal lifestyle and what you would like to be able to fund. A mortgage of a certain size? Exotic vacations? College tuition for your children?

Right now, for example, stocks are relatively cheap because so many people have sold off shares, which means anyone buying can get them at a discount to their values from a year ago. Corey’s rule of thumb doesn’t just apply to stocks. “Buy a foreclosed house, fill it up with roommates, and you can get a pretty good passive income,” he suggests.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Live below your means</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Even Eminem, a celebrity and millionaire, scales back his purchases out of concern for frugality.

That’s why Corey recommends going into the field that you find yourself reading about in your spare time. He asks, “Do you read fashion magazines? Get a job in fashion. Do you read gossip blogs? Get a job in celebrity-based enterprises. Do you read Car &amp; Driver? ESPN.com? Yahoo Pets Forum?” Even if the field doesn’t seem lucrative, there are ways to make it to the top–something that’s more likely to happen if you love it.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>[For more, read: “<a href=\"http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=ApmXV9kqkoYwrSj41EjcLGnFLs8F/SIG=122klelh4/**http%3A/www.usnews.com/sections/business/your-money/index.html\">Juggling Your Money in the Recession</a>.”]</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Decide how much money you really want</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>For many people, $1 million won’t be enough. “For most Gen-X and Gen-Yers, retiring with a couple million when they are 65 won’t be anywhere near enough to maintain even an average lifestyle, because that little pup called inflation is constantly nipping at your heels as you try to run towards building your own retirement nest-egg,” says Cartwood. A more reasonable goal might be $3 million– an amount that Cartwood considers the minimum to be a “bare bones millionaire” these days. Consider your ideal lifestyle and what you would like to be able to fund. A mortgage of a certain size? Exotic vacations? College tuition for your children? Having a concrete goal in mind makes it easier to get there, says Cartwood.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Invest against the grain</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Corey recommends making investment decisions based on the exact opposite of what everyone else is doing. Right now, for example, stocks are relatively cheap because so many people have sold off shares, which means anyone buying can get them at a discount to their values from a year ago. Corey’s rule of thumb doesn’t just apply to stocks. “Buy a foreclosed house, fill it up with roommates, and you can get a pretty good passive income,” he suggests.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p><strong>Live below your means</strong></p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>Even Eminem, a celebrity and millionaire, scales back his purchases out of concern for frugality.

Eminem reportedly said, “I don’t want to run out of money; I want my daughter to be able to go to college.” And so far, at least, Eminem hasn’t fallen victim to the financial challenges so many other stars, from Aretha Franklin to Annie Leibovitz, have faced.</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>[For more, read: “<a href=\"http://us.lrd.yahoo.com/_ylt=AmFNlI017CwjiEdjc0pxVJ3FLs8F/SIG=138opc22c/**http%3A/www.usnews.com/articles/business/your-money/2008/09/16/how-to-go-broke-like-a-rock-star.html\">How to Go Broke Like a Rock Star</a>.”]</p>\r\n<!-- /wp:paragraph -->\r\n\r\n<!-- wp:paragraph -->\r\n<p>On the same note, Smith says that even though she’s a millionaire, no one would know it–and that’s the point.
